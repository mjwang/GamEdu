GamEdu is developed as part of a D-Lab Education Project supporting the Instituto Pedagógico Miguel De Zubiría. It is a web application that allows teachers to create educational games for elementary school aged children. The website provides the framework for several different types of games (ie. matching, who wants to be a millionaire, falling tiles). All the teacher needs to do is enter a set of questions and answers, and the website will create a game around that content. Teachers can edit the questions and answers at any time as well as choose whether a game is ready to be displayed to students. Students can then sign into the student version of the website and play the games created by the teachers.
