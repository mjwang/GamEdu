The original intention was\nthat the 2.x.x series of Bootbox would simply require Bootstrap >= 2.x.x - since\nboth projects use Semantic Versioning this should have been possible. However,\nBootstrap 2.2.x (and possibly 2.1.x) introduced breaking changes - or at least\nchanges considered backward incompatible in the context of this project. Over\ntime bugs started getting raised which eventually turned out to be due to subtle\nchanges in Bootstrap's code. Therefore, **2.5.1** was the last release which will\nsupport Bootstrap 2.0.x and is **not guaranteed** to work with anything higher than\nBootstrap 2.0.4.\n\nBootbox *3.0.0* is the first release to support Bootstrap 2.2.x. More about this [on the Bootbox website](http://bootboxjs.com/#dependencies).\n\n### Roadmap\n\nThe next major release of Bootbox - 4.0.0 - will involve a complete rewrite of the\ninternal code and introduce an entirely new public API. It will most likely require\nBootstrap 3.0.0 (assuming that sees the light of day first).\n\nYou can get a quick overview of the roadmap in the form of the project milestones\n[as listed in the issue tracker](https://github.com/makeusabrew/bootbox/issues/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date).\n\n## Latest Release: 3.2.0\n\n* ensure ```onEscape``` handlers return callback values properly (GH-91)\n* ensure clicking close button invokes onEscape handler if present\n\n### 3.1.0\n\n* ensure ```confirm``` and ```prompt``` methods return callback values properly (GH-90)\n* address various jshint warnings (GH-79)\n* add ```setBtnClasses``` method for custom standard button classes (GH-87)\n\n### 3.0.0\n\n* bump Bootstrap dependency to 2.2.2\n* bump jQuery dependency to 1.8.3\n* ensure callbacks are always invoked even if dialogs are dismissed with escape key (GH-49)\n* fix button positions with Bootstrap 2.2.2 (GH-58)\n* stop multiple dialogs crashing browsers (GH-60, GH-64)\n* ensure ```shown``` event is fired properly even when animation is disabled (GH-69)\n* use ```.on``` instead of ```.bind```\n* commentify code a bit more\n\n### 2.5.1\n\n**This was the last version of the library which supports Bootstrap 2.0.x**\n\n* ensure bootbox object is explicitly added to window object for minfier visibility\n\n### 2.5.0\n\n* add option to specify proper href attributes for buttons instead of callbacks (@StevePotter)\n* add option to override per-modal classes (@ciaranj)\n\n### 2.4.2\n\n* revert ```backdrop``` default value to 'static' instead of ```true``` to prevent background clicks dismissing dialogs (GH-55)\n\n### 2.4.1\n\n* fix ```backdrop``` when supplied as an argument to ```bootbox.dialog```\n* fix incorrect README version\n\n### 2.4.0\n\n* add ```bootbox.backdrop(bool)``` method (@gucki)\n* add default parameter option to ```bootbox.prompt``` (@pzgz)\n\n### 2.3.3\n\n* add inline ```overflow: hidden``` CSS property (GH-46)\n* move license info to separate hosted file to reduce file size\n\n### 2.3.2\n\n* Change button href attributes to ```javascript:;``` (@joshnesbitt)\n* Explicitly ```window.jQuery``` through to ```Bootbox``` object (@nuegon)\n\n\n### 2.3.1\n\n* Ensure bootbox.prompt() gives focus to input, disable input autocomplete\n\n### 2.3.0\n\n* Added bootbox.prompt() to mimic native prompt() method\n* Added Russian locale (#27)\n\n### 2.2.0\n\n* Allowed button callbacks to explicitly return false to prevent dialog from closing (thanks @benoit-ponsero)\n* Added version number to header comments (#26)\n\n### 2.1.2\n\n* Added close button to re-scoped click handler (thanks @SeanMcGee and @kentbrew)\n\n### 2.1.1\n\n* Fixed incorrect button click handler selector (thanks FGRibreau)\n\n### 2.1.0\n\n* Added support for Bootstrap's Glyphicons via the ```icon``` option\n* Added inline license information into bootbox.js and bootbox.min.js\n* Tidied up source a little\n\n### 2.0.1\n\n* Removed dummy Google Closure Compiler method from minified library (thanks j0k3r!)\n\n### 2.0.0\n\n* Updated Bootstrap dependency from 1.4 to 2.0\n* Class definitions now require ```btn-``` prefix as per Bootstrap 2.0\n* Added Brazilian locale\n* Added ```animate``` dialog option\n* Added ```bootbox.animate(bool)``` option to set default animation preference\n* Animated dialogs now rely on ```bootstrap-transitions.js``` as required by Bootstrap 2.0\n\n### 1.1.2\n\n* Added licensing information to README\n\n#### 1.1.1\n* Updated german locale\n\n#### 1.1.0\n* Secondary option of two-button dialog no longer has 'danger' class\n* New bootbox.modal() method for generic non-dialog popups\n* Allow jQuery objects to be passed as main dialog argument\n\n## License\n\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright (C) 2011-2012 by Nick Payne <nick@kurai.co.uk> \n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
